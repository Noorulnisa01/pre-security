# 📡 Task 4: Ping – The Network Diagnostic Tool

---

## 🛠️ What is Ping?

**Ping** is one of the most basic and powerful network troubleshooting tools used to:

- Test **connectivity** between devices
- Measure **latency** (round-trip time)
- Check **packet loss**
- Determine **reliability** of a network connection

---

## 📨 How Does Ping Work?

Ping operates using **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**, specifically two types of messages:

| ICMP Type        | Purpose                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Echo Request     | Sent to the target device       |
| Echo Reply       | Response from the target device |

### 🧪 Workflow:

1. Your device sends an **ICMP Echo Request** to the target.
2. The target responds with an **ICMP Echo Reply**.
3. The ping utility measures the **round-trip time (RTT)**.

---

## 💻 Syntax and Usage

Ping comes **pre-installed** on most operating systems, including:

- **Linux**
- **Windows**
- **macOS**

### ✅ Basic Syntax:
```bash
ping <IP_address>         # e.g., ping 8.8.8.8
ping <domain_name>        # e.g., ping google.com
```

### 🖼️ Example Output:
```bash
Pinging 192.168.1.254 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.1.254: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.1.254: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.1.254: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=64

Ping statistics for 192.168.1.254:
    Packets: Sent = 3, Received = 3, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 4ms, Maximum = 4ms, Average = 4ms
```

📌 This tells us:
- 3 packets sent, 3 received (0% loss)
- Response time was ~4ms

## ⚠️ Common Ping Errors

| Error                      | Meaning                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Request Timed Out`       | No response from the target (device unreachable)       |
| `Destination Host Unreachable` | No route to target (often local config issue)    |
| `Unknown Host`            | Domain name not resolved (DNS issue)                   |

## 🔍 Ping Parameters (Advanced)

| OS        | Example Flag            | Description                            |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows   | `-n`                    | Number of echo requests to send        |
|           | `-t`                    | Ping the host until stopped (Ctrl+C)   |
| Linux/macOS | `-c`                  | Count of packets to send               |
|           | `-i`                    | Interval between pings (in seconds)    |

### Example:
```bash
ping -c 5 8.8.8.8      # Send 5 packets only (Linux/macOS)
ping -n 5 8.8.8.8      # Send 5 packets only (Windows)
```


## 🧠 What Does Ping Tell You?

| Result                          | Meaning                                               |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Replies with low latency     | Network is healthy and responsive                      |
| 🟡 High latency (e.g., >100ms) | Possible network congestion or distance issue          |
| ❌ "Request timed out"          | Device is unreachable, offline, or firewall is blocking|
| 🔁 Packet Loss                  | Indicates poor connection or interference              |

## 🌍 Common Use Cases

- Test **connectivity** to:
  - Local devices (`192.168.1.X`)
  - Internet resources (`ping 8.8.8.8`)
- Detect **ISP issues** or **DNS failures**
- Check if a **website or server is online**
- Measure **network delay and jitter**

---

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Try the following on your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

🔍 This IP address is a public DNS server run by **Google** and often used to test general Internet connectivity.

## 🧰 Advanced Ping Options

### 🐧 Linux/macOS:
```bash
ping -c 5 google.com        # Send only 5 packets
ping -i 2 8.8.8.8           # Wait 2 seconds between pings
ping -s 128 8.8.8.8         # Set packet size to 128 bytes
```

### 🪟 Windows:
```cmd
ping -n 5 google.com        # Send 5 echo requests
ping -l 128 8.8.8.8         # Packet size: 128 bytes
ping -t google.com          # Ping until manually stopped (Ctrl+C)
```
