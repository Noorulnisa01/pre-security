# 🛡️ Introduction to CyberSecurity

Cybersecurity is broadly categorized into two major areas:

**1. Offensive Security  
2. Defensive Security**

---

## 🔓 1. ***Offensive Security***

Offensive security focuses on **breaking into systems**, **exploiting vulnerabilities**, and **finding loopholes** to simulate what an attacker might do. The ultimate goal is to understand hacker techniques and enhance system defenses.

### 🔍 Key Roles in Offensive Security:

- **Penetration Tester**  
  Tests technology products for exploitable security vulnerabilities.

- **Red Teamer**  
  Acts as an adversary, attacking an organization to provide feedback from an enemy’s perspective.

- **Security Engineer**  
  Designs, monitors, and maintains security controls, networks, and systems to prevent cyberattacks.

> Red Teams and Penetration Testers specialize in offensive techniques.

## 🛡️ 2. ***Defensive Security***

Defensive security focuses on **preventing intrusions** and **detecting/responding** when they occur. Blue teams are responsible for these activities.

### 🔐 Main Objectives:

- Prevent intrusions
- Detect intrusions
- Respond to incidents appropriately

### 🧰 Common Defensive Security Tasks:

- **User Cybersecurity Awareness**  
  Educating users about phishing, password hygiene, and social engineering.

- **Asset Management**  
  Documenting and managing systems/devices to be secured.

- **System Updates & Patching**  
  Keeping all systems updated to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

- **Preventative Security Devices**  
  Using firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to filter traffic.

- **Logging & Monitoring**  
  Detecting unauthorized devices and suspicious behavior through effective monitoring.

## 🧭 3. ***Areas of Defensive Security***

### 🔵 Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **SOC** is a team of cybersecurity professionals that monitor systems and networks to detect malicious events.

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Vulnerability Management**  
  Fixing or mitigating system weaknesses.

- **Policy Violation Monitoring**  
  Ensuring users adhere to security policies.

- **Unauthorized Activity Detection**  
  Identifying stolen credentials or abnormal access behavior.

- **Intrusion Detection**  
  Recognizing attacks like malicious links or server exploits.

### 🧠 Threat Intelligence

**Threat Intelligence** is about gathering and analyzing information related to **actual or potential cyber threats**.

#### Key Concepts:

- Intelligence is gathered from logs, forums, and threat feeds.
- Data is collected, processed, and analyzed to detect adversary patterns.
- Helps predict attacker behavior and supports **threat-informed defense**.

> ***Examples of threat actors:***
>
> - ***Nation-state cyber armies***
> - ***Ransomware gangs***
> - ***Hacktivists***

#### 🛠️ Open-Source Tools:

- **AbuseIPDB** – Check IP reputation and report malicious IPs  
- **Cisco Talos Intelligence** – Threat detection and investigation

> Security analysts use these tools for alert investigation and reputation checks. You can contribute to a safer internet by reporting bad actors.

### 🧪 ***Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)***

DFIR involves **investigating cyber incidents**, understanding the attack, and initiating proper responses.

#### 📁 1. ***Digital Forensics***

Focuses on analyzing:

- **File Systems** – Revealing installed, deleted, and hidden files
- **System Memory** – Capturing malware in memory-only operations
- **System Logs** – Identifying anomalies and attack footprints
- **Network Logs** – Understanding attack patterns through traffic analysis

#### 🚨 2. **Incident Response**

Incident response outlines how to react to data breaches, malware outbreaks, and intrusions.

##### 🔄 Four Phases of Incident Response:

1. **Preparation** – Team readiness and proactive defense
2. **Detection and Analysis** – Identifying and assessing incidents
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** – Isolate, clean, and restore systems
4. **Post-Incident Activity** – Document findings and improve future defenses

---

### 🦠 3. **Malware Analysis**

**Malware** is any software created with malicious intent, such as viruses, trojans, and ransomware.

#### 🧬 Types of Malware:

- **Virus** – Code that spreads by attaching to programs
- **Trojan Horse** – A seemingly harmless program that performs malicious actions
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts user data and demands ransom for access

#### 🧫 Malware Analysis Techniques:

- **Static Analysis**  
  Inspecting malware code without executing it (requires knowledge of assembly).

- **Dynamic Analysis**  
  Running malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.
